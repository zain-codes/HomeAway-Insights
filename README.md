## Project Overview
HomeAway Insights is a data-driven initiative that combines in-depth analysis and machine learning to pinpoint profitable real estate investment opportunities and to understand vacation-oriented market trends. Our project leverages historical data, tourist activity, economic indicators, and housing statistics to deliver strategic insights for real estate investors and companies like *Prello*.

## What's Inside the repository?
* In-depth data analysis of tourist establishments, seasonal home occupancy rates, and salary metrics.  
* Machine learning models that predict real estate profitability and classify municipalities based on second home proportions.
* A data dashboard visualizing key market indicators for easy interpretation.

### Analytics hypotheses & Objectives Overview
* Hypothesis 1: High tourist activity in towns correlates with increased rental yields for second homes.  
* Hypothesis 2: Municipalities with higher average income levels are likely to experience stable real estate appreciation.  
* Hypothesis 3: A higher density of second homes in a municipality suggests a vacation-oriented market orientation.

### Data Analysis, Visualization, and dashboarding 
* Interactive visualizations to explore the distribution and key metrics of municipalities.
* Geographic visualizations on maps highlight the areas with high potential for vacation-oriented real estate investments.

### Machine Learning Implementation

* Market Classification: For Hypotheses 2, use of classification algorithms to identify markets with a demand for vacation homes and to assess the impact of income levels on market dynamics.
